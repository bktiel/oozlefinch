# Oozlefinch

Oozlefinch is a studying tool that leverages a game to make the process slightly less monotonous. Heavily inspired by a TIE fighter typing
game that has disappeared off the internet as far as I can tell (if you find it, please give me a shout).

Made in Godot 3.5.1, successfully builds against Windows and HTML5 targets

To use this for your own purposes just swab out `tabs.csv` with your own CSV following the same format and build.
